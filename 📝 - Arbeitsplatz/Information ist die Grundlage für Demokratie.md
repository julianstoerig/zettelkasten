## Interpretationen anderer, die ich lesen sollte:

> Democracy fundamentally differs from other forms of government in one point: rulers need to win the elections.
> 
> In order to win the elections, they have to persuade the voters rhat they are better suited for the job than other candidates or parties. This works in the following way:
> 
> 1.  brainwash the voters until they believe that the picture of good and bad that you sell is the right one.
> 2.  present your side as the only guarantee that the good will win
> 3.  present the other side as wrong at best and as raving lunatics with criminal intent if possible.
> 
> In order to do this, one has to control the information. In less abstract terms:
> 
> Berlusconi has ruined Italy by installing the laws that only profited himself, but he owned a media impery that made him look like a hero to italians.
> 
> Putin, Erdogan and Urban are acting as dictators, but manage to persuade the voters that they are the national saviours by controlling the information.
> 
> Trump is as corrupted as it gets, plus rasist and sexist on top of this, but he managed to present all this as “cool” and to perauade his voters that Hillary is the corrupt one.
> 
> And so on. The one who controls the information controls a democracy.

> Perhaps I could add a complex adaptive systems perspective on the question. Information is the life-blood of complex responses within a system, and so could be called a “currency” of exchange, although I agree with Martin that the metaphor does not really work. Without a free flow of information, there could likely be no democracy, as the governance and market processes which allow people in a democracy to make effective choices would wither. The bottom-up ability of democracy to respond to challenges is resilient—even anti-fragile—as long as democratic institutions work and information is freely available. But people representing special interests find it difficult to make a democratic system serve their masters. While it is an inefficient system of governance, it is very good at frustrating authoritarian desires, and when compared to the alternatives would seem to be the best approach to governance available to generate greater wealth and success for the majority of people over the long-term. For those special interests for whom democratic governance has itself become the problem, however, there is no more effective way to gain power than to disrupt the flow of information it uses to coordinate itself. Propaganda is a time-tested way of shaping the information people use to make decisions. Once the preserve of governments alone, it has now become the turf of private think tanks and media companies, who effectively create information bubbles for their audiences. But today we also have “filters” in information networks which skew access to information in the name of an optimised customer experience, sealing users into even more granular information silos than the ideological media bubbles have been able to achieve. “Fake news” in these network filters goes one step further in dislocating information flows by disconnecting information from factual reality. I experience what is happening to information at the moment as a kind of Denial of Service attack. As it intensifies and swamps the information landscape, the decision-supporting service that healthy information flows provide fails. Unable to get an overview, and unable to trust what we have access to through the information DDOS, we experience a loss of orientation in our attempts to understand the world in order to be able to make sensible decisions. Without reliable information, democracy is at risk. I would think that that is the whole point of the information wars that are just coming into their own. Without our ability to orient ourselves under the attack, we fall back onto primitive emotions as a basis for making decisions. And nothing pleases authoritarian groups more than such chaos, in which they can credibly demand to be given total control over everything to fix the problem. So, to preserve democracy, we need to ensure that we have reliable information that is freely available. Unfortunately, I have no idea how we could manage to ensure that in the current environment.
