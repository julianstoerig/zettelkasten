Democracy fundamentally differs from other forms of government in one point: rulers need to win the elections.

In order to win the elections, they have to persuade the voters rhat they are better suited for the job than other candidates or parties. This works in the following way:

1.  brainwash the voters until they believe that the picture of good and bad that you sell is the right one.
2.  present your side as the only guarantee that the good will win
3.  present the other side as wrong at best and as raving lunatics with criminal intent if possible.

In order to do this, one has to control the information. In less abstract terms:

Berlusconi has ruined Italy by installing the laws that only profited himself, but he owned a media impery that made him look like a hero to italians.

Putin, Erdogan and Urban are acting as dictators, but manage to persuade the voters that they are the national saviours by controlling the information.

Trump is as corrupted as it gets, plus rasist and sexist on top of this, but he managed to present all this as “cool” and to perauade his voters that Hillary is the corrupt one.

And so on. The one who controls the information controls a democracy.
