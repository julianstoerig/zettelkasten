A value of a resource at time t , Vt , that has an initial value of V 0 and grows at a rate R can be written as follows: 

### Vt = V 0 (1 + R ) t 

This single-equation model plays central roles in finance, economics, demography, ecology, and technology. When applied to finance, the variable is money. Using the equation, we can calculate that a $1,000 bond paying 5% annual interest increases in value by $50 in year one and by more than $100 in year twenty. To draw clean inferences, we assume a constant growth rate. Given that assumption, we can manipulate the exponential growth equation to derive the _rule of 72_.
