Growth Model Output depends on physical capital ( K ), educated labor ( S ), and uneducated labor ( U ) as follows: 

### Output = AKαSβ Uγ 

 The parameters A , α , β , and γ capture the technology and the relative value of the three types of labor. The relative market wage for highand low-skilled workers is:^7 

 Cause of inequality : Technological changes that favor educated workers increase β and decrease γ. These changes, along with increases in the supply of low-skilled workers, increase inequality. 

The next model, the _positive feedback model_ , can explain the increased variation within professions. It focuses on the tail of the distribution and, in particular, on entrepreneurs. In 2011, entrepreneurs made up 70% of the 400 wealthiest individuals in the United States.^8 The model assumes that technologies—the internet and smartphones in particular—have made us more connected and 

more influenced by the choices of others.^9 A person buying wireless stereo speakers can read reviews online and select “the best” from among a dozen choices. In the past, that person might have had a single option at her local stereo store. Now, a person who twists her knee can search the web and learn the identity of her favorite athlete’s doctor. That behavior creates a positive feedback and more inequality. We model socially influenced economic choices by reframing the preferential attachment model as a model that links

positive feedbacks to talent. Though the positive feedbacks model cannot be fitted to time series data with the same fidelity as the previous technology model, we can look to experiments to see how feedbacks contribute to inequality. Recall the music lab experiments described in Chapter 6. College students sampled and downloaded music under two treatments. In the first treatment, subjects could not see what music others had downloaded. This treatment captures the pre-internet world. In the second treatment, subjects could see the download numbers for each song. In the treatment without social information, no song receives more than two hundred downloads and only one song receives fewer than thirty. When people can see downloads, one song receives more than three hundred downloads and over half receive fewer than thirty. Information and social influence amplify the Matthew effect. The rich get even richer, and the poor become relatively poorer.
