An alternative consists of N valence attributes : = ( v 1 , v 2 ,..., vN ). 

 Individual preferences are captured by weights = ( w 1 , w 2 , ..., wN ) assigned to the attributes. 

 The payoff (utility) to an individual from an alternative equals π ( , ) = w 1 · v 1 + w 2 · v 2 + ··· + wN · vN 

 . 

 Example: = (3, 1, 2), = (4, 2, 5): π ( , ) = 4 · 3 + 2 · 1 + 5 · 2 = 24 

 . 

Some of those attributes, such as a swimming pool or a new kitchen, have market prices. As a check on the model, we can compare the estimated prices to the market costs. If the regression shows that a swimming pool adds $150,000 to the price of a house and swimming pools cost $15,000, we know the model is missing attributes. If the regression shows the added value to be only $8,000, then this likely means that people do not recover the full costs of adding pools. Other attributes, such as the commute time from the house to the city center, do not have market prices. In those cases, the regression produces an implicit price for that attribute, and that implicit price can be informative. The table below shows hypothetical price data for six houses.

If we assume the houses are identical on all other attributes and we run a hedonic regression, we obtain the following equation: 

 Price ($) = 100(Square Ft) + 20,000(# Bedrooms) − 2000(Commute Time) 

The regression equation estimates that people value each additional square foot at $100, each bedroom at $20,000, and each minute saved commuting at $2,000 over the period of home ownership. A person who lives in a house for twenty years spends 4,000 to 5,000 days commuting. If we take the lower number, each extra minute of daily commute time results in 4,000 minutes, or over 60 hours, commuting. The $2,000 estimate equates to around $30 an hour. In other words, people pay for proximity “as if” they are paying themselves $30 an hour to sit in traffic.^15

### A Hybrid Model of Product Competition 

The spatial and hedonic models differ in how they represent preferences over attributes. In the _spatial model of competition,_ each person has a preferred level of each attribute, and his value for an alternative increases as it gets nearer his ideal point on those dimensions. In the hedonic model, people prefer either more or less of each attribute. Many of the choices we model—over consumer goods and services, ideal life partners, public policies, religions, and job applicants—include both spatial and hedonic attributes. We may each have our own preferred level of crispiness for french fries, yet we all prefer to pay less per serving. Crispiness is spatial. Price is hedonic. Employers likely differ in the personality characteristics they look for in potential employees. Some firms prefer extroverts. Others may prefer introverts. All firms prefer more honesty and integrity. Thus, personality type is a spatial attribute, while honesty is a hedonic attribute. We can thus create a hybrid model in which the alternatives contain both spatial and hedonic attributes. This model can be used to analyze market entry, product differentiation, and the extent of price competition. If we return to our example of the chocolate bars, before choosing a new product’s attributes, an entrant might first place the three existing products in attribute space and then survey consumers to learn about the distribution of their ideal points. The entrant could then estimate the Voronoi neighborhoods for her proposed product. If that neighborhood contains few consumers, she should not expect substantial sales. Any entrepreneur considering entering a market can take this approach. A boot designer can plot existing designs of insulated boots, of which there may be dozens, and find that none come in shiny patent leather. Someone designing a smartphone app for making to-do lists can map the features of existing apps, measure total market demand, and project possible sales.

We can visualize a price reduction in the spatial model of competition as a movement of the cut line. Refer back to figure 20.3 showing the two chocolate bars. The cut line corresponds to the ideal points of consumers who are indifferent between _A_ and _B_. If the firm producing _B_ lowers its price, and if consumers prefer to pay less for candy bars, then this will shift the cut line toward _A_ and increase _B_ ’s market share. We do not need the model to know that _B_ lowering its price should increase its market share. We do need the model to estimate the magnitude of that effect. The key will be to distinguish between _crowded markets,_ with a large number of products in a lowdimensional attribute space, and a _sparse market,_ where there are few competitors. In a crowded market, each product has a small Voronoi neighborhood. In a sparse market, the Voronoi neighborhoods are huge. 

Figure 20.9: Price Competition in Sparse and Crowded Markets Price changes have different effects in the two types of markets. Figure 20.9 shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% price reduction in candy bar _B_ , from $2.00 to $1.80. The diagram on the left shows a sparse market. Lowering the price for _B_ shifts the cut line between product _A_ and _B_ and increases _B_ ’s market share from 50% to 54%, an 8% increase in _B_ ’s market share. The 10% price drop and 8% sales increase reduces revenue by 3%. Lowering prices would be a bad idea. The diagram on the right shows a crowded market with seven types of candy bars. Here, the price drop has a smaller effect on _B_ ’s absolute market share, an increase of 5% from 15% to 20%, but this 5% represents a larger proportional increase (33%) in _B_ ’s market share. The overall effect is a 20% increase in revenue.^16 Thus, the model predicts stronger price competition in crowded markets than in sparse markets, and extreme competition for _commodities_ : products that are indistinguishable, like crude oil, pork

bellies, and red wheat #2. It predicts less price competition for highend fashion goods, where designers can sustain substantial price markups because product dimensionality creates a sparse market. This relationship between the number of attributes and the extent of price competition suggests that a good strategy would be to add new attributes. This would make the market more sparse, reduce price competition, and lead to higher profits. Even if that inference is correct, the strategy may be easier stated than accomplished. People must value the new attribute. For each successful attribute— cordless stereo speakers—one can find multiple failed attempts— Bic’s ill-fated disposable underwear.

### Summary 

The spatial model of competition, the hedonic model of competition, and a hybrid of the two provide a framework within which we can represent different products, political candidates, or even job applicants. These models can measure ideological positions, price implicit attributes, and evaluate potential market entry positions. They generate insights into how market competition creates an incentive for differentiation, how political competition creates an incentive for convergence, and how price competition should be more intense for products with fewer attributes. In the models, we make rather strong and empirically dubious assumptions. For example, we assume that people do not change their preferences, and that they do not succumb to social pressures. If that were so, why do firms and politicians spend enormous amounts of money trying to change preferences? We could shrug off this criticism by referring again to Box’s dictum that all models are wrong. We can also construct a more nuanced response that distinguishes between _fundamental preferences_ , the outcomes that a person desires, and her _instrumental preferences_ , the person’s preferences over the attributes that produce the fundamental outcomes. A student’s fundamental preferences may strike a balance between being popular, healthy, and scholarly. She may pursue these fundamental ends through instrumental actions— waking early, going to the juice bar, and completing her homework so as to have time to be social in the evenings. Her choice of the fruit shake helps her to achieve a fundamental preference for good health. It is an instrumental preference. If she comes across a scientific paper revealing the high sugar content in fruit shakes, she may switch to drinking water. If so, her instrumental preferences change even though her fundamental preferences do not. Once again, we see how a model is not an end in itself but provides an architecture to structure our thinking.
