Given L workers and K units capital, the total output equals: 

 Output = Constant · L a K(1− a ) 

 where a is a real number between 0 and 1 capturing the relative importance of labor. 

We use the Cobb-Douglas model to construct models of economic growth. To simplify, we assume 10,000 workers in the economy and ignore wages and prices, allowing us to focus on how the number of machines affects total output. We can then connect investment in capital to growth. To make the model as simple as possible, we assume that output takes the form of a single commodity, coconuts. The coconuts provide flesh and rich milk for food. However, the coconuts grow high in trees, so the workers require machines to pick them. We then make the very unrealistic assumption that the machines are constructed from coconuts. This simplifies the model but maintains the key trade-off between consumption today and investment in the future As a special case of the Cobb-Douglas model, we write output as the square root of the number of workers times the square root of the number of machines. 

If the economy has one machine, output equals 100 tons. If people consume all 100 tons of coconuts, they invest in no new machines. Output will be unchanged in the next year. The economy exhibits no growth. If they invest 1 ton of coconuts to build a second machine, output increases to 141 tons, a 41% growth rate. If they 

build a third machine, output grows to 173 tons.^9 Through a constant investment, the economy grows at a decreasing rate. Output is a concave function.
