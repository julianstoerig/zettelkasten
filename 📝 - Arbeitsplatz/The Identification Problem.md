Data on people’s actions often reveals clustered behavior. Good students are more likely to be friends with other good students than with students who struggle. People who engage in criminal behavior are more likely to interact with other people who commit crimes than are people who do not commit crimes. Any number of social goods and ills—smoking, physical fitness, obesity, and even happiness—cluster in social networks. People also cluster by beliefs: Democrats cluster. Republicans cluster. Libertarians cluster. We have two models that can explain clustering: _peer effect models_ and _sorting models_. Peer effect models explain clustering with game theory. Individuals play a coordination game with their friends. In sorting models, people move to be near others who are like them. A cluster of good students could result from either students coordinating on a common behavior (peer effects) or arise because good students choose to hang out with one another (sorting). Given a snapshot of data, the two are indistinguishable. 

**Data** : Students earn either high _H_ or moderate _M_ scores, with each being equally likely. Students belong to friendship cliques of size 4 with the following distribution: _p_ ({ _H_ , _H_ , _H_ , _H_ }) = _P_ ({ _M_ , _M_ , _M_ , _M_ }) = , _p_ ({ _H_ , _H_ , _H_ , _M_ }) = _P_ ({ _M_ , _M_ , _M_ , _H_ }) = , and _p_ ({ _H_ , _H_ , _M_ , _M_ }) = 0. 

**Peer effect model** : Students originally form random groups of size 4: _p_ ({ _H_ , _H_ , _H_ , _H_ }) = _P_ ({ _M_ , _M_ , _M_ , _M_ }) = , _p_ ({ _H_ , _H_ , _H_ , _M_ }) = 

_P_ ({ _M_ , _M_ , _M_ , _H_ }) = , and _p_ ({ _H_ , _H_ , _M_ , _M_ }) = People who belong to groups consisting of only one type remain unchanged. A person who has the opposite type from everyone else switches type, so an { _H_ , _H_ , _H_ , _M_ } group becomes { _H_ , _H_ , _H_ , _H_ }. In groups with equal numbers of each type, one member switches type.

The group { _H_ , _H_ , _M_ , _M_ } is equally likely to become { _H_ , _H_ , _H_ , _M_ } or { _M_ , _M_ , _M_ , _H_ }. 

**Sorting model** : Students originally form random groups of size 

4. In any group with two types, a person who has the opposite type as at least two other people switches groups with someone of the other type. It follows that { _H_ , _H_ , _H_ , _M_ } becomes { _H_ , _H_ , _H_ , _H_ } and { _M_ , _M_ , _M_ , _H_ } becomes { _M_ , _M_ , _M_ , _M_ }, and that any group of the form { _H_ , _H_ , _M_ , _M_ } is equally likely to become { _H_ , _H_ , _H_ , _M_ } or { _M_ , _M_ , _M_ , _H_ }.     Both models are consistent with the data, creating an **identification problem**. With only a snapshot of data, we cannot determine whether smoking, reading manga, or longboard skateboarding are peer effects or sorting. In some instances, we can reason through which model applies. The tendency for people to say “pop” in the Midwest and “soda” on the coasts is something that we can safely assume to be driven by peer effects—few people move to Boston so that they can refer to Coke as “soda.” On more important behaviors such as educational performance, drug use, obesity, and happiness, we need time series data to discern which model applies. By looking across time, we can discern if people change their behaviors to fit in with their friends (peer effect), or if they change their friends and retain their behaviors (sorting). In many cases of interest such as school performance, both 

effects may be in play.^2
