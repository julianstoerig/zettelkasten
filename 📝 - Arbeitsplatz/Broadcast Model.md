### It +1 = It + P broad Â· St 

 where P broad denotes the broadcast probability , and It and St equal the number informed and susceptible at time t. 

 Initially, I 0 = 0 and S 0 = N POP. 

The _broadcast model_ captures the spread of ideas, rumors, information, or technologies through media like television, radio, or the internet. Knowledge of most current events spreads through broadcast. The model captures processes in which a source, which could be the government, a corporation, or a newspaper, spreads information. It could also capture contaminations that spread through a water supply. The model does not apply to diseases or ideas that spread from person to person. As the broadcast model better fits the spread of ideas and information than disease, we refer to the number of people informed, as opposed to the number infected. The number of informed people in a given time period equals the number informed in the previous period plus the probability that a susceptible person hears of the information multiplied by the number of susceptible people (see box). By convention, the initial population contains only susceptible people. Calculating the number of informed people in all future periods involves plugging the number of informed and susceptible people into the difference equation. The result will be an r-shaped adoption curve. Imagine that the mayor of a city with 1 million residents announces a new tax policy. Prior to the announcement, no one could have known about the policy. If we assume the probability that someone hears the news on any given day equals 30% ( _P_ broad =

0.3), then 300,000 people hear about it the first day. On the second day, 30% of the remaining 700,000 people, or 210,000, hear about it. In each period, the number of informed people increases and does so at a decreasing rate, as shown in figure 11.1. 

Figure 11.1: The r-Shaped Adoption Curve Produced by the Broadcast Model In the broadcast model, everyone in the relevant population learns the information or buys the product. Using initial sales data, we can therefore estimate the relevant population size. Suppose that a company introduces a new line of shoes for people who practice tai chi, and in the first week, it receives orders for 20,000 pairs of shoes. If in the second week it receives orders for 16,000 pairs, we can make a crude estimate of eventual total sales, the size of the relevant population, to be 100,000.
