Sorting Model and Categories Each individual has an education level: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} where 1 = dropout, 2 = high school diploma, 3 = some college, 4 = college degree, and 5 = postgraduate. 

 Let P ( m , j ) and P ( w , j ) denote the probability that a man and woman have education level j. Income( g , l ) equals the (estimated) income of a person of gender g and income level l. Household income for a couple consisting of a man with education level lM and a woman with education level lW earns the following estimated household income:^12 

 Income( M , lM ) + Income( W , lW ) 

 Cause of inequality: Increases in the number of educated women, increased pay for workers with higher levels of education, and assortative mating (the tendency for people to marry others of the same income level) result in an increase in household-level income inequality. 

Had marriages been random rather than assortative, income inequality would be much less. One study finds that inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient, a common measure of inequality, would have decreased by 25%.^13 Our next model analyzes movements between income categories using a Markov model. It categorizes people (or households) by income level: high, upper middle, lower middle, and low. Each category contains one-fourth of the distribution. Given a time period —it could be a year, a decade, or a generation—we can then estimate the transition probabilities between income categories to capture mobility.
