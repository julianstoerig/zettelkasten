As shown in the table below, measles, which can spread through the air, has a higher reproduction number than HIV, which spreads through sexual contact and needle sharing. Estimates of _R_ 0 do not 

assume that people change their behavior in response to a disease. Parents might respond to a lice infestation in a school by keeping their children at home, lowering the probability of contact. Or, they might shave their children’s heads, reducing the probability of spreading when contact occurs. Both of these behavioral changes would lower lice’s _R_ 0. 

**R 0** 

**Measles** : 15 **Polio** : 6 **HIV** : 4 **Influenza** : 3 In the absence of a vaccine, quarantine is an option, but it is costly.^7 If a vaccine exists, then vaccination can prevent disease spread. Disease spread can be prevented even without vaccinating everyone. The proportion of people who must be vaccinated, the _vaccination threshold,_ is given by the formula which we can 

derive from the model.^8 The vaccination threshold increases with _R_ 0. To prevent the 

spread of polio, which has an _R_ 0 of 6, the vaccine must cover of 

the population. To stop the spread of measles, which has an _R_ 0 of 

15, the vaccine must cover of the population. The mathematical

derivation of the vaccination threshold provides guidance to policy makers. If too few people are vaccinated, then the disease will spread, so governments vaccinate more than the threshold amount estimated by the model. For diseases with high basic reproduction numbers, such as measles and polio, governments try to vaccinate everyone. Some people worry about side effects of vaccines and choose not to participate in vaccination programs. If these people constitute a small percentage of the population, the vaccination of others prevents them from catching the disease. Epidemiologists call this phenomenon _herd immunity_. The people who choose not to get the vaccine _free ride_ off the vaccinations of others. We study free riding 

in greater detail later in the book.^9
