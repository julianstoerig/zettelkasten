Given a discrete time dynamical system consisting of the transition rule xt +1 = G ( xt ), the real-valued function F ( xt ) is a Lyapunov function if F ( xt ) ≥ M for all xt and if there exists an A > 0 such that 

 If F is a Lyapunov Function for G , then starting from any x 0 , there exists a t ∗, such that G ( xt ∗) = xt ∗, and the system attains an equilibrium in finite time. 

We first construct a Lyapunov function within the _Race to the Bottom Game_ , which captures strategic environments in which players choose levels of support such that each player prefers to provide just less than the average level.
