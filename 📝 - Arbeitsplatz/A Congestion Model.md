M of N people choose to use a resource. Their utility can be written as follows: 

### Utility(M) = B − θ · M 

 where B denotes the maximal benefit , and θ is a congestion parameter. The remaining ( N − M ) people abstain and receive utility of zero.^9 

 Socially optimal : M = Utility = 

 Nash equilibrium : M = Utility( ) = 0 

In the socially optimal solution, the number of people who use the resource equals the maximal possible benefit divided by twice the congestion parameter. Those findings align with our intuition. The number of people who use the resource should increase with the maximal benefit and decrease with greater congestion effects. In the Nash equilibrium solution, exactly double the socially optimal number of people use the resource. Congestion becomes so severe that no one receives any benefit. That result is an artifact of the assumption that not using the resource gives a utility of zero. This finding has the counterintuitive implication that a community that builds a beautiful park may not produce much utility for its citizens. In equilibrium, the park will be sufficiently crowded such that being at the park is no more enjoyable than staying home. When a model produces a result that runs counter to common sense, we need to reason through the result. People must be happier having a park, so the model must be wrong. It is wrong, because we assumed identical preferences. If people vary in how

much they enjoy the park, then some people may be receiving positive utility, while others get no benefit. Second, the model assumes the park is always crowded. That will not be true. Third, the alternative option might be going to the beach, not staying home. The new park may make the beach less crowded. Finally, people enjoy diverse experiences. If the city has a skateboard park, a dog park, and a water park, then people may get benefits from the diversity of experience over a period of weeks. Those challenges notwithstanding, the main result still has some teeth. During busy times, congestion will rise to the point where the park produces no more benefit than any other activity. Crowding will still occur, though not as much as when there was a single park. In addition, as shown in the box below, the creation of multiple parks offers no guarantee that people allocate themselves across those parks optimally. In the example shown in the box on the next page, in equilibrium, too many people go to the larger park. In addition to creating more parks, a community could try other solutions such as rationing, rotating access, running a lottery, fees, and enlarging capacity. Rationing gives each person or household a fixed amount of the resource. This solution works for divisible resources like water. It is less practical for roads. Rotation schemes divide use of the resource by time. During air pollution alerts, a city can restrict roads to cars with even(or odd-) numbered license plates on certain days. Other resources, such as placements in popular public schools, cannot be rationed or rotated. In those cases, lotteries can be held.
