Gain Framing: You have two options: Option A: Win $400 for certain. Option B: Win $1,000 if a fair coin comes up heads, and $0 if tails. 

 Loss Framing: You are given $1,000 and have two options: Option : Lose $600 for certain. Option : Lose $0 if a fair coin comes up heads, and lose $1,000 if tails. 

 A and : are equivalent as are B and. According to prospect theory, more people choose A and. 

_Hyperbolic discounting_ implies stronger discounting of the immediate future. Standard economic models assume _exponential discounting,_ a constant rate at which people discount the future. A person with an annual discount rate of 10% values $1,000 next year as equal to $900 today. She would discount next year’s money by 10% for every year into the future. Evidence shows that most people do not discount the future at a fixed discount rate. Instead, they suffer from an _immediacy bias_ : they discount the near future far 

more than the later future.^16 For example, if you ask people whether they would prefer $9,500 twenty years from now or $10,000 twenty years and one day from now, almost everyone will wait one more day for the extra $500. If you ask those same people if they would prefer $9,500 today or $10,000 tomorrow, many will take the $9,500 now. This is an example of immediacy bias.^17 That bias produces time-inconsistent behavior. One year from now, most people prefer waiting one more day and taking the $10,000. Such preferences are not logically consistent. Hyperbolic discounting has been put forward as a reason why people run up

credit card debts, eat unhealthy foods, have unprotected sexual relations, and fail to save for retirement. In summary, depending on how we will use our model, we may choose to assume loss aversion and hyperbolic discounting given that these assumptions appear to better match behavior for most people. The main reason not to do so would be if they complicate the model without qualitatively changing what we find, or if by assuming hyperbolic discounting our model produces unrealistic behavior.

### Rule-Based Models 

We now turn to rule-based models.^18 While optimization-based models assume an underlying utility or payoff function that people maximize, rule-based models assume specific behaviors. A rulebased model might assume that in an auction, a person will bid 10% less than her true value for an item, or that a person will copy a friend’s action if that friend consistently receives higher payoffs. Many people equate optimization-based models with mathematics and rule-based models with computation. The distinction between optimization-based models and rule-based models is not as clean as might be thought. Think back to our model of housing consumption. Optimal behavior took the form of a simple rule: spend one-third of income on housing. The key difference between the two approaches lies in their foundational assumptions. In an optimization-based model, preferences or payoffs are fundamental. In a rule-based model, the behavior is fundamental. Behavioral rules can be fixed or adapt. A fixed rule applies the same algorithm at all times. Just as rational-choice models provide an upper bound on people’s cognitive abilities, fixed-rule models provide a lower bound. A common fixed rule in markets, the _zero intelligence rule,_ accepts any offer that produces a higher payoff. It never takes a stupid (i.e., utility-reducing) action. Suppose we want to gauge the efficiency of a one-sided market design in which sellers post take-it-or-leave-it offers for some good. A seller following a zero intelligence rule would randomly pick a price above her value. A buyer would purchase any good with a price below her value. When we encode those behaviors in a computer model, we find that in markets zero-intelligence traders produce nearly efficient outcomes. Thus, exchange markets do not need rational buyers and sellers to 

function well.^19 An adaptive rule switches among a set of behaviors, evolves new behaviors, or copies the behaviors of others. It takes these actions in order to improve the payoff. Therefore, unlike fixed rules, adaptive

rules require a utility or payoff function. Advocates of this approach argue that within any situation people tend toward simple and effective rules, and that if this is what people do, we should model 

them in that way.^20 Though rule-based models make no explicit assumption about rationality, adaptive-rule models exhibit ecological rationality—better rules come to predominate.^21 To explain how adaptive-rule models operate, we describe the _El_ 

_Farol model_ of self-organized coordination.^22 El Farol is a nightclub in Santa Fe, New Mexico, that features dancing every Tuesday night. Each week, a population of 100 potential dancers decide whether to go dance at El Farol or stay home. All 100 people like to dance, but they do not want to go if the club is too crowded. The model assumes a stark form of preferences. A person earns a payoff of zero from staying home, a payoff of 1 from attending if 60 or fewer people attend, and a payoff of -1 from attending when more than 60 people attend. If we construct a fixed-rule model, anything might result. For example, if we assigned everyone the rule “go the first week; if more than 60 people attend, do not go the next week; and then go the following week,” the El Farol would have 100 attendees the first week, zero attendees the second week, and then 100 attendees the third week. The El Farol model creates adaptive rules by endowing each person with an ensemble of rules. Each rule tells the individual whether or not to go to El Farol. The rules take several forms. Some are fixed rules: go every other week. Others are based on trends in the number of people who attended El Farol in recent weeks. One rule might predict that the number of people that show up this week will be the same as last week. If fewer than 60 people attended last week, that rule would tell the person to go this week. An adaptive behavioral rule model might assign a score to each rule equal to the percentage of weeks for which it gave correct advice. Each individual might then use the model in her ensemble with the highest score. The best rule will vary over the course of the weeks. Simulations of this type of model find that if individuals possess a large ensemble of rules, then approximately 60 people

attend each week: coordination emerges without any central planner. In other words, the system of adaptive rules self-organizes into nearly efficient outcomes.
