### One-to-Many 

Learning models takes time, effort, and breadth. To reduce those demands, we take a _one-to-many_ approach. We advocate mastering a modest number of flexible models and applying them creatively. We use a model from epidemiology to understand the diffusion of seed corn, Facebook, crime, and pop stars. We apply a model of signaling to advertising, marriage, peacock feathers, and insurance premiums. And we apply a rugged-landscape model of evolutionary adaption to explain why humans lack blowholes. Of course, we cannot take any model and apply it to any context, but most models are flexible. We gain even when we fail because attempts at creative uses of models reveal their limits. And it is fun. The one-to-many approach is relatively new. In the past, models belonged to specific disciplines. Economists had models of supply and demand, monopolistic competition, and economic growth; political scientists had models of electoral competition; ecologists had models of speciation and replication; and physicists had models describing laws of motion. All of these models were developed with specific purposes in mind. One would not apply a model from physics to the economy or a model from economics to the brain any more than one would use a sewing machine to repair a leaky pipe. Taking models out of their disciplinary silos and practicing one-tomany has produced notable successes. Paul Samuelson reinterpreted models from physics to explain how markets attain equilibria. Anthony Downs applied a model of ice cream vendors competing on a beach to explain the positioning of political candidates competing in ideological space. Social scientists have applied models of interacting particles to explain poverty traps, variation in crime rates, and even economic growth across countries. And economists have taken models of self-control based on economic principles to understand the functioning of the brain.^7

### One-to-Many: Higher Powers ( XN ) 

Creatively applying models requires practice. To provide a preview of the potential of the _many-to-one_ principle, we take the familiar 

formula of a variable raised to a power, _XN_ , and apply it as a model. When the power equals 2, the formula gives the area of a square, when the power equals 3, it gives the volume of a cube. When raised to higher powers, it captures geometric expansion or decay. 

**Supertankers:** Our first application considers a cubic supertanker whose length is eight times its depth and width, which we denote by _S_. As shown in figure 3.1, the supertanker has a surface area of 34 _S_^2 and a volume of 8 _S_^3. The cost of building a supertanker depends primarily on its surface area, which determines the amount of steel used. The amount of revenue a supertanker generates depends on its volume. Computing the ratio of volume to surface area, , reveals a linear gain in profitability from increasing 

size. 

Figure 3.1: A Cubic Supertanker: Surface Area = 34 _S_^2 , Volume = 8 _S_^3 Shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos, who knew this ratio, built the first modern supertankers and made billions during the period of rebuilding that followed World War II. To give some sense of scale: the T2 oil tanker used during World War II measured 500 feet long, 25 feet deep, and 50 feet wide. Modern supertankers such as the _Knock Nevis_ measure 1,500 feet long, 80 feet deep, and 180 feet wide. Imagine tipping the Willis (Sears) Tower in Chicago on its side and floating it in Lake Michigan. The _Knock Nevis_ resembles a T2 oil tanker scaled up by a factor of a little over three. The _Knock Nevis_ has about ten times the surface area as a T2 oil tanker and over

thirty times the volume. A question arises as to why supertankers are not even larger. The short answer is that tankers must pass through the Suez Canal; the _Knock Nevis_ squeezes through with a gap of a 

few feet on each side.^8 

**Body mass index:** Body mass index (BMI) is used by the medical profession to define weight categories. Developed in England, BMI equals the ratio of a person’s weight (in kilograms) to her height in meters squared.^9 Holding height constant, BMI increases linearly with weight. If one person weighs 20% more than another person of the same height, the first person’s BMI will be 20% higher. We first apply our model to approximate a person as a perfect cube made up of some mixture of fat, muscle, and bone. Let _M_ denote the weight of one cubic meter of our cubic person. The human cube’s weight equals its volume times the weight per cubic 

meter, or _H_^3 _· M_. Our cube’s BMI equals _H · M_. Our model reveals two flaws: BMI increases linearly with height, and given that muscle weighs more than fat, fit people have higher _M_ and therefore higher BMIs. Height should be unrelated to obesity, and muscularity is the _opposite_ of fatness. These flaws remain if we make the model more realistic. If we make a person’s depth (thickness front to back) and width proportional to height using parameters _d_ and _w_ , then BMI can be written as follows: The BMIs of many NBA stars and other athletes place them in the overweight category 

(BMI > 25), along with many of the world’s top male decathletes.^10 Given that even moderately tall, physically fit people will likely have high BMIs, we should not be surprised that a meta-analysis of nearly a hundred studies with a combined sample size in the millions found that slightly overweight people live longest.^11 

**Metabolic rates:** We now apply our model to predict an inverse relationship between an animal’s size and its metabolic rate. Every living entity has a metabolism, a repeated sequence of chemical reactions that breaks down organic matter and transforms it into energy. An organism’s metabolic rate, measured in calories, equals 

---

the amount of energy needed to remain alive. If we construct cubic models of a mouse and an elephant, figure 3.2 shows that the smaller cube has a much larger ratio of surface area to volume. 

Figure 3.2: The Exploding Elephant We can model the mouse and the elephant as composed of cells 1 cubic inch in volume, each with a metabolism. Those metabolic reactions produce heat that must dissipate through the surface of the animal. Our mouse has a surface area of 14 square inches and a 

volume of 3 cubic inches, a surface-to-volume ratio of roughly 5:1.^12 For each cubic-inch cell in its volume, the mouse has five square inches of surface area through which it can dissipate heat. Each heat-producing cell in the elephant has only one-fifteenth of a square inch of surface area. The mouse can dissipate heat at seventy-five times the rate of the elephant. For both animals to maintain the same internal temperature, the elephant must have a slower metabolism. It does. An elephant with a mouse’s metabolism would require 15,000 pounds of food per day. The elephant’s cells would also produce too much heat to be dissipated through its skin. As a result, elephants would smolder and then explode. The reason elephants do not blow up is that they have a metabolism roughly twenty times lower than that of mice. The model does not predict the rate at which metabolism scales with size, only the direction. More elaborate models can explain the scaling laws.^13 

**Women CEOs:** For our last application, we increase the exponent in 

---

the formula and use the model to explain why so few women become CEOs. In 2016, fewer than 5% of Fortune 500 companies had women CEOs. To become a CEO a person must receive multiple promotions. We can model those promotion opportunities as probabilistic events: a person has some probability of receiving a promotion. We further assume that to become CEO, a person must be promoted at each opportunity. We assume fifteen promotion opportunities as a benchmark, as that corresponds to a promotion every two years on a thirty-year path to CEO. The weight of evidence reveals modest biases in favor of men, which we can model as men having a higher probability of 

being promoted.^14 We model this as a man’s probability of promotion, _PM_ , being slightly larger than a woman’s, _PW_. If we 

benchmark these probabilities at 50% and 40%, respectively, then a man is nearly thirty times more likely than a woman to become CEO.^15 The model reveals how modest biases accumulate. A 10% difference in promotion rates becomes a 30-fold bias at the top. This same model provides a novel explanation for why a much larger percentage (about 25%) of college and university presidents are women. Colleges and universities have fewer administrative layers than Fortune 500 companies. A professor can become president in as few as three promotions: department chair, dean, and then president. Less bias accumulates over three levels. Thus, the larger proportion of women presidents need not imply that educational institutions are more egalitarian than corporations.

### Summary 

We began the chapter by laying logical foundations for the many-toone approach using the Condorcet jury theorem and the diversity prediction theorem. We then used categorization models to show the limits of model diversity. We saw how many models can improve our abilities to predict, act, design, and so on. We also saw that it is not easy to come up with many diverse models. If we could, then we could predict with near perfect accuracy, which we know we cannot. Nevertheless, our goal will be to construct as many useful, diverse models as possible. In the chapters that follow, we describe a core set of models. Those models make salient different parts of the world. They make different assumptions about causal interactions. Through their diversity they create the potential for productive many-model thinking. By emphasizing distinct parts of more complex wholes, each model contributes on its own. Each also can be part of an even more powerful ensemble of models. As noted earlier, many-model thinking does require that we know more than one model. However, we need not know a huge number of models, so long as we can apply each model that we do know in multiple domains. That will not always be easy. Successful one-tomany thinking depends on creatively tweaking assumptions and constructing novel analogies in order to apply a model developed for one purpose in a new context. Thus, becoming a many-model thinker demands more than mathematical competence; it requires creativity as was evident in our many applications of our model of a cube.
