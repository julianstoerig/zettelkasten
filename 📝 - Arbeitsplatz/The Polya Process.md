An urn contains one white ball and one gray ball. Each period a ball is drawn randomly and returned to the urn along with an additional ball of the same color as the one drawn. The color of the ball drawn denotes the outcome. 

The Polya process captures a variety of social and economic phenomena. A person’s choice of whether to learn to play tennis or racquetball could depend on the choices of others. A person might be more likely to choose tennis if more of her friends also choose tennis, as it increases her chances of finding a game. Similarly, a person’s decision about what type of software to buy, language to learn, or smart-phone to buy could also depend on earlier choices by friends. Similar logic also applies to choices by firms over which technological standards to adopt. They may base their choices on the actions of others. The model captures these social influences by changing the distribution of balls. If gray balls represent people who choose tennis and white balls represent people who choose racquetball, then as more people choose tennis, the urn contains more gray balls, causing subsequent people to be more likely to choose tennis as well. This increasing pull toward the outcome that more people choose creates path dependence. 

 Figure 14.1: Outcomes Consisting of Two White Balls and One Gray Ball We can derive two unexpected properties of the Polya process.

First, any sequence with the same number of white outcomes occurs with equal probability. Second, every distribution of white and gray balls occurs with equal probability. The second property implies extreme path dependence. Anything can happen. Everything is equally likely. After 1,000 periods, the probability that the urn contains 40% white balls equals the probability that it contains 2% white balls. To see why, consider all possible sequences of outcomes in the first three periods. The first period outcome is gray with probability. 

If so, we add a gray ball, increasing the probability that the second outcome will be gray to. If that outcome is also gray, we add a third gray ball, increasing the probability that the third outcome is gray to 

. It follows that the total probability of three gray balls (or three white balls) equals times times , which equals.     The three sequences in which the first three outcomes consist of two white balls and one gray ball are shown in figure 14.1. In the top row, the order of the outcomes is gray, white, and then white. The probability of this sequence is , as is the probability of other 

sequences. It follows that the probability of getting one of the three sequences equals. By symmetry, the probability of choosing two gray balls and one white ball also equals. Therefore, each set of 

outcomes—three white, three gray, two white and one gray, and two gray and one white—occurs with the same probability of. Moreover, sequences of two white and one gray also occurs with equal 

probability. Similar results can be shown for any number of periods.^5 If we extend the _Polya process_ to add balls of additional colors, extensions of both regularity properties still hold. Any proportion of the colors can arise and is equally probable. These results create a conundrum for producers of consumer products. Long-run consumer preferences for some product attributes may be random. Knowledge that an outcome cannot be predicted can still inform action. Ford would not want to build 40,000 yellow pickup trucks and later find that red emerged as the favorite color from a path-dependent process. The potential for unsold inventory in unwanted colors points to two potential actions. A company could construct its supply chain

so that color choices come last; for example, a clothing company might wait to dye sweaters until popular colors become clearer. Or a company could choose to not give people a choice. Henry Ford offered his customers any color Model T they desired, so long as it was black. Apple did the same when it rolled out the first iPhone: you could get black, or, for the same price, you could get black.

### The Balancing Process 

Our second model, the _balancing process,_ makes the opposite assumption of the Polya process. After drawing a ball of one color, we add a ball of the opposite color. If we draw white balls in the first two periods, the urn will contain three gray balls and only one white ball, resulting in a probability of drawing a gray ball. This process produces path-dependent outcomes, in that the likelihood of an outcome in any period depends on the history of past outcomes. However, it does not produce path-dependent equilibria. In the long 

run, the urn converges to equal proportions of each color ball.^6
