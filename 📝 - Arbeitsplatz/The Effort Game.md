Each of N players chooses an effort level expressible in monetary terms to win a prize of value M. The probability that a player wins the prize equals her effort divided by the total effort of all players. If Ei equals the effort level of player i , her probability of winning is given by the following equation:^1 

 Equilibrium: 

We can see the effects on individual and total effort by increasing the number of players. Here, the findings are less intuitive. According to the model, individual players’ effort levels decrease but the total effort by all players increases. Thus, the model implies that efforts by organizers of research grant opportunities, architectural competitions, and essay contests to attract large numbers of entrants may, paradoxically, produce lower-quality winners because in the larger contests, participants have less incentive to put in effort.

### Summary 

We began this chapter by covering zero-sum games. These games assume no mutually beneficial combinations of actions. Any action that proves good for one player necessarily hurts another player. In a zero-sum decision, any action harms someone as much as it helps someone else. Taking money from one person and giving it to another is a zero-sum action. Many personal actions and policy choices are zero-sum in at least one dimension. We have only so many hours in the day, so much money to spend, and so many resources to allocate. That said, a zero-sum action in one dimension may not be zero-sum in another. A budget relocation could be zerosum in monetary terms but positive or negative sum in terms of human happiness or fulfillment. We should always explore whether a proposed policy change creates a zero sum game. For example, many people argue for school choice—giving parents the ability to choose the school their child will attend—because it increases competition. Market logic suggests that by being forced to compete, schools have incentives to improve quality. However, schools only have an incentive to improve quality if excess capacity exists. Otherwise, school choice can create a zerosum game among the students. Imagine a city with 10,000 students and 10 schools each with a capacity for 1,000 students. If the students rank the schools in the same order, spots in the best schools will have to be allocated by lottery. Those who win the lottery will go to better schools. Those who lose the lottery will go to worse schools, who remain in operation because of a lack of excess supply. Students are playing a zero-sum game. If new schools open, or if existing schools improve, the game is no longer zero-sum. Everyone can win. Both the market and the zero-sum models provide insights. The market model reveals incentives for quality improvements and for the creation of new schools. The zero-sum model shows that school

choice alone means that some students will gain while others lose. The relative weight we should place on each model depends on the context: Does sufficient excess capacity exist in the better schools so that they can absorb the additional students? Do schools have the resources and expertise to improve their quality? Will entrepreneurs create new schools? Does the transportation system enable students to get to multiple schools in order to create competition? Our takeaway should be that neither of the two models gives us a correct answer, but each produces useful insights. School choice will create competition. It also creates a massive sorting problem with features of a zero-sum game. Whether the positive aspects of competition will outweigh the negative sorting costs depends on the context. We must array our lattice of models on the set of facts to make a good policy choice.
