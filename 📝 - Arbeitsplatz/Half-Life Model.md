If every H periods half of the remaining quantity decays, then after t periods the following holds: 

### Proportion Remaining ≈ 

A novel application of the half-life model comes from psychology. Early psychological studies showed that people forget information at a near-constant rate. Our half-life of remembering depends on the 

salience of the event.^4 In 2016, the film _Spotlight_ won the Academy Award for Best Picture. If people’s memory of Oscar winners has a half-life of two years, in 2018, of people will have remembered that fact, but by 2026, only will recall it. The recollection of any 

particular event varies across people. Tom McCarthy, who directed and cowrote _Spotlight,_ will likely never forget the year he won the Academy Award.

### Concave Functions 

Concave functions are the opposite of convex functions. Concave functions have slopes that decrease. Concave functions with positive slopes exhibit _diminishing returns_ : the added value of each extra thing diminishes as we have more of that thing. Our utility or value from almost all goods exhibits diminishing returns. The more leisure, money, ice cream, or even time spent with loved ones, the less we value having more of it. Evidence for this can be found in the fact that the more we consume of just about anything, including chocolate, the less we enjoy it and the less we are willing to pay for it.^5 Diminishing returns can explain a variety of phenomena, including why long-distance relationships are often so happy. If you see your partner just a few hours each month, every additional minute is wonderful. After a month of uninterrupted togetherness, the slope of the happiness curve flattens, and those few extra moments matter 

less.^6 It explains why developers invite people for free weekend visits to their beachfront condominiums. During a short weekend, you cannot get enough time on the beach. You are inclined to buy. After ten days on the beach, though, you may become bored. When we assume concavity, we imply a _preference for diversity_ and _risk aversion_. To show the former requires a concave function with multiple arguments. If our happiness is concave and increasing in both leisure and money, we prefer some leisure and some money to all leisure and no money or all money and no leisure. Risk aversion means a preference for a sure thing over a lottery. A riskaverse person prefers a certain payoff of $100 to a lottery that pays $200 half of the time and nothing the other half of the time. A riskaverse person prefers a double-dip ice cream cone to having either no ice cream or an unwieldy four-scooper. Figure 8.1 shows why concavity implies risk aversion. The figure plots happiness for values for three outcomes: a high outcome ( _H_ ), a low outcome ( _L_ ), and the mean of those outcomes ( _M_ ). Given the 

---

downward-shaped curve, happiness at the mean outcome exceeds the average happiness of the low outcome and the high outcome. The opposite holds for convex functions. Convexity implies _riskloving_ : we prefer the extremes to the average. The amount of a stock you can buy is a convex function of its price. Therefore, buyers of stocks prefer price volatility. If prices go up and down, buyers end up 

with more stocks than if prices stay constant.^7

### Economic Growth Models 

We next construct a series of economic growth models. These models reveal the causes of growth and can explain and predict growth patterns across countries. They can also guide actions such as increasing the savings rate. To lay the foundation for our study of growth models, we introduce a standard economic production model in which output depends on labor and physical capital. Empirical evidence and logic support concavity of output in both labor and capital. Holding the amount of capital fixed, labor should be worth less as more is added. Similarly, adding more machines or computers adds less value given a fixed number of workers. Logic also suggests that output should be linear in scale. Doubling both the number of workers and the amount of capital should double output. A broom-making company with sixty workers and one factory that builds a second factory and hires sixty additional workers should double its output. The _Cobb-Douglas model,_ one of the most widely used models in economics, includes both properties. Output is concave in labor and capital and linear in scale. This model can be applied to capture production by single firm or by an entire economy.^8
