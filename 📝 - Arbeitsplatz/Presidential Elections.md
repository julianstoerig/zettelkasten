We now apply three models to analyze outcomes in presidential elections: the spatial model, the category model, and the multiarmed bandit model. 

**Spatial model:** To attract voters, candidates compete in an ideological issue space. Thus, we should expect candidates to tend toward moderate positions, elections to be close, and the winning sequence of parties to be random. Presidential elections are, with a few exceptions, close. To test if the sequence of winners is random, we first construct a time series of the thirty-eight winning parties from 1868 through 2016.

We can then measure the _block entropy_ of subsequences of various lengths. Subsequences of length 1 have entropy 0.98. Subsequences of length 4 have entropy of 3.61. Statistical tests show that we cannot reject that the sequence is random. For comparison, a random sequence of length 38 had block 1 entropy of 1.0 and block 4 entropy of 3.58. 

**Category model:** If we think of each state as a category and assume heterogeneity across states, the spatial model implies that once the candidates choose initial positions, some states will not be competitive. The model predicts fierce competition in a handful of moderate states. In 2012, Obama and Romney spent over 96% of their television advertising budgets in ten states. Each spent nearly half of their advertising budgets in three moderate states: Florida, Virginia, and Ohio. In 2016, Clinton and Trump also spent more than half of their television dollars in three moderate states: Florida, Ohio, and North

**Multi-armed bandit model (retrospective voting)** : Voters will be more likely to reelect a party that produces good outcomes. Voting for effective parties corresponds to pulls of a lever that generate a high payoff. A strong economy should benefit the incumbent party. Evidence shows that voters are more likely to reelect the party in power when the economy performs well. The effect is larger for the incumbent candidate than for a 

nonincumbent candidate from the party in power.^8
