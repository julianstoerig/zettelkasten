Production Function: O ( t ) = 100 

 Investment Rule: I ( t ) = s · O ( t ) 

 Consumption-Investment Equation: O ( t ) = C ( t ) + I ( t ) 

 Investment-Depreciation Equation: M ( t + 1) = M ( t ) + I ( t ) − d · M ( t ) 

 O ( t ) = output, M ( t ) = machines, I ( t ) = investment, C ( t ) = consumption, s = savings rate, and d = depreciation rate 

Now that we have the basic idea of how investment drives growth, we can construct a more elaborate model that includes an investment rule. We can write investment as _savings rate_ times output and assume a fixed _depreciation rate_ on the machines, such as that the number of machines that are no longer useful at the end of the year equals a fixed proportion of the number of machines. We can then write the total number or machines in the next year as last year’s machines plus the investment in new machines minus the machines lost to depreciation. The complete _simple growth model_ consists of four equations. If we assume the economy has 100 machines, a savings rate of 20%, and a depreciation rate of 10%, output equals 1,000 tons of coconuts, consumption equals 800 tons, and new investment equals 200 machines. A total of 10 machines will be lost to depreciation, leaving 290 machines at the start of the new year. Similar calculations show that in the second year, outcome will equal 1,702 

tons and in the third year it will equal almost 2,500 tons.^10 In the first three years, output increases at an increasing rate. This initial convexity is a result of the small number of machines in the first few

years implies almost no effect of depreciation. Over time the number of machines grows and depreciation starts to matter making output concave. In the long run it ceases altogether, as shown in figure 8.2. By analyzing the model we can see why. Investment is linear in output: the number of new machines added grows linearly with output. Output is concave in the number of machines, so as the economy grows, investment will also be concave in the number of machines. Depreciation, though, is linear in the number of machines, and eventually the linear depreciation catches up with the concave increases in production. 

Figure 8.2: Output in the Basic Growth Model for One Hundred Years In the _long-run equilibrium_ of the economy the number of new machines created by investment equals the number lost to depreciation. In our model, the equilibrium occurs when economy has 40,000 machines and produces 20,000 tons of coconuts. At that point, the economy invests 20% or 4,000 coconuts, in new machines and loses exactly that many machines to depreciation (10% of the 40,000). Thus, the number of new machines lost to depreciation equals the number of new machines created through investment and growth stops.^11

### The Solow* Growth Model 

We now construct a more general model that is a simplification of the _Solow growth model_ (thus the asterisk). We replace machines with physical capital and include labor as a variable. We also add a technology parameter that increases output linearly. Innovations increase this parameter. As in the previous model, the long-run equilibrium occurs when investment equals depreciation. Here, though, the equilibrium-level output depends on the amount of labor and on the technology parameter, as well as the savings and depreciation rates.^12
