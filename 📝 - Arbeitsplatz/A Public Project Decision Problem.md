Let ( V 1 , V 2 ,···, VN ) denote the monetary values that N people attach to a public project with cost C. The project should be undertaken if and only if 

### C < V 1 + V 2 + ··· + VN 

We first consider the _majority-vote equal sharing mechanism_. In this mechanism, individuals vote whether to undertake the project. If a majority vote yes, the cost of the project is divided equally among the population.
