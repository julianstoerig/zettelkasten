A Markov process converges to a unique statistical equilibrium provided it satisfies four conditions: 

 Finite set of states : S = {1, 2,..., K }. 

 Fixed transition rule: The probabilities of moving between states are fixed, for example, the probability of transitioning from state A to state B equals P ( A , B ) in every period. 

 Ergodicity (state accessibility): The system can get from any state to any other through a series of transitions. 

 Noncyclic: The system does not produce a deterministic cycle through a sequence of states. 

The takeaway from the theorem should not be that history cannot matter but that if history does matter, one of the model’s assumptions must be violated. Two assumptions—the finite number of states and no simple cycle—almost always hold. Ergodicity can be violated, as when allies go to war and cannot transition back to an alliance. Such examples notwithstanding, ergodicity generally holds as well. That leaves the restriction to fixed transition probabilities between states as the assumption least likely to hold. Thus, the model says that when history matters, underlying structural forces must change transition probabilities (or change the set of states). Consider the challenge of helping families to escape poverty. The forces that create social inequality have proven immune to policy interventions.^3 In Markov models interventions that change families’ states—such as special programs for underperforming students or a one-day food drive—can provide temporary boosts. They cannot change the long

run equilibrium. In contrast, interventions that provide resources and training that improve people’s ability to keep jobs, and therefore change their probabilities of moving from employed to unemployed, could change long-run outcomes. At a minimum, the model gives us a terminology—the distinction between states and transition probabilities—along with a logic to see the value of changing structural forces rather than the current state.
