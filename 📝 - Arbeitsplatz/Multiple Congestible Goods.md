M people go to Park 1 and ( N − M ) go to Park 2. To account for Park 2 being larger, utilities are as given below:^10 

 Park 1: Utility( M ) = N − M 

 Park 2: Utility( N − M ) = 3 N − 3 · ( N − M ) 

 Socially optimal : M = creating total utility N^2 

 Nash equilibrium : M = creating total utility 

For access to roads, fees are a popular solution. The city of London charges a fee to enter the central city. Limited-access toll roads around the world do the same. Usage fees allocate the resource to those willing to pay the most. These may not be the people who would get the most utility. Singapore uses a combination of fees and limited access. Singapore auctions a fixed number of motor vehicle permits each year. The permits, which last for ten years, often sell for more than the price of a typical car. To reduce congestion during peak times, Singapore, like London, also charges fees for driving into the central business district. Singapore’s traffic moves smoothly for a city its size, and the government raises substantial amounts of money, which can then be used for public transportation. Enlarging the capacity of roads has had mixed success. When a city adds lanes to highways to increase traffic flow, it makes housing near the highways more desirable, a positive feedback. A resulting increase in housing creates more traffic, requiring even wider roads, producing a positive feedback loop similar to those described in the systems dynamic models covered in Chapter 18.

### Renewable Resource Extraction 

Last, we consider _renewable resource extraction,_ in which individuals share a resource that regenerates itself. This model applies to forests, watersheds, grasslands, and fisheries. In each case, the amount of the resource available in the future depends on how much we use now. If too much was used, the resource may not regenerate fast enough. The need for regeneration of the resource makes these problems more fragile than public good problems or congestion problems. A city that underfunds public lighting in one year can increase spending the next year without enduring long term effects from its mistake. If a community overfishes a stream or overharvests a forest, it pays lasting costs because to make fish, you need fish. You do not need streetlights to make streetlights. Furthermore, the renewable resource may be a necessity: food to eat, water to drink, and fuel to keep warm. People need to extract the resource to live.
