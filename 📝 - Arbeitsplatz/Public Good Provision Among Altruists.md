N people have altruistic preferences with weight α on aggregate utility: 

 Equilibrium pure altruists ( α = 1): PUBLIC = N 

 Equilibrium general solution:^6 PUBLIC = 

 Example: α = : PUBLIC ≈ 

Given that we do not live in a world of pure altruists, we must look to other mechanisms, such as taxation. Governments impose taxes to pay for roads, national defense, education, criminal justice systems, and other public goods. Determining the amount of the tax requires a more elaborate model that includes income and preference heterogeneity. People could vote on an amount and a common tax rate. The spatial voting model predicts a tax rate equal to the preferred level of the public good for the median voter. That level may not be socially optimal if people have heterogeneous incomes and preferences. Many public goods such as schools, roads, and recycling programs can be classified as _local_. A local community can exclude others, but within the community the public good is non-rival and non-excludable. For local public goods, allowing people to sort into communities based on their preferences, what is called _Tiebout sorting_ , offers a possible solution to the public good provision problem. People who want better schools, public parks, pools, and police protection can vote for higher taxes to pay for those public goods. Those people who do not want the local public goods can live

in a separate community and pay lower taxes. Tiebout sorting is not a cure-all. It brings attendant costs, including lower social cohesion. Moreover, when high-income people isolate themselves, they reduce public good provision in poorer communities and reduce network 

interactions that can transfer information and knowledge.^7

### The Congestion Model 

In a second type of collective action model, involving resources such as roadways, beaches, and water systems, the value to an individual decreases with the number of users. Anyone who has spent time stuck in traffic has experienced a congestion problem. A wide-open road brings more pleasure and utility than one clogged with cars. Estimates place the costs of traffic delays in the United States in the neighborhood of $100 billion a year. In some cities, notably Los Angeles and Washington, DC, commuters spend, on average, more than sixty hours per year in traffic. Our _congestion model_ assumes a resource of fixed capacity. Each day, people can use the resource or abstain. An individual’s benefit from using the resource decreases linearly with the number of other users.^8 The slope of the line, the _congestion parameter,_ captures the magnitude of the congestion effect.
