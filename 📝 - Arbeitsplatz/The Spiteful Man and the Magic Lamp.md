A spiteful man finds a bronze lamp while on an archeological expedition. He rubs the lamp and a genie appears. The genie proclaims, “I will grant you one wish for anything that you desire, and because I am a benevolent genie, I will give everyone you know double what I give you.” The man ponders the proposition, grabs a stick, and says, “Poke out one of my eyes.” 

 The spiteful man takes an action that gives him a low absolute 

payoff and a high relative payoff.^11 A similar tension exists in foreign affairs. Neoliberals believe that countries want to maximize absolute payoffs measured by military power, economic prosperity, and domestic stability. Another camp, known as neorealists, believes that countries value relative payoffs. A country would rather have a lower absolute payoff but be stronger than its enemies. Kenneth Waltz, a neorealist, wrote at the height of the Cold War, “The first concern of states is not to maximize power but to maintain their positions in the system.”^12 Neorealists would claim that during the height of the Cold War, had either Russia or the United States rubbed the magic lamp, each would have handed the genie a stick. We can embed the conflict between absolute and relative gains in an _N_ -person game with a generous action that increases absolute payoffs for everyone along with a spiteful action that only increases one’s own payoff. This game differs from a collective action game, 

where generosity comes at a cost.^13 The formal game with payoffs is shown in the box. The generous action is a dominant strategy. Regardless of the actions of the other players, a player choosing generous receives a higher payoff. However, on average the players choosing spiteful earn higher payoffs. These may at first appear to be contradictory statements. They

are not. By being generous a player raises his absolute payoff by 3 but also raises the payoffs of all other players by 2. A player who chooses to be spiteful raises his payoff by only 2 but does not raise the payoffs of the other players. Each player improves his payoff by choosing to be generous. When a player chooses to be spiteful, he reduces his payoff, but (and here’s the key assumption) he reduces the payoff to everyone else by an even larger amount.
