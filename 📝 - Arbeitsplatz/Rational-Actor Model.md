An individual’s preferences are represented by a mathematical utility or payoff function defined over a set of possible actions. The individual chooses the action that maximizes the function’s value. In a game, that choice may require beliefs about the actions of other players. 

As an example, we construct a primitive rational-actor model of an individual’s decision for how much income to allocate to housing. The model characterizes her utility as a function of housing and all other consumption, with the latter including food, clothing, and entertainment (see box). The model assumes a price for housing and a price for all other goods. The model is far from realistic. It treats all housing the same. And, it lumps all other goods into one category called consumption and prices them all the same. We can set those inaccuracies aside for the moment, as the purpose of the model is to explain the proportion of income spent on housing.
