Each of an odd number of people (models) classifies an unknown state of the world as either true or false. Each person (model) classifies correctly with a probability p > , and the probability that any person (model) classifies correctly is statistically independent of the correctness of any other person (model). 

 Condorcet jury theorem: A majority vote classifies correctly with higher probability than any person (model), and as the number of people (models) becomes large, the accuracy of the majority vote approaches 100%. 

Ecologist Richard Levins elaborates on how the logic of the theorem applies to the many-model approach: “Therefore, we attempt to treat the same problem with several alternative models each with different simplifications but with a common biological assumption. Then, if these models, despite their different assumptions, lead to similar results, we have what we can call a robust theorem, which is relatively free of the details of the model. 

Hence our truth is the intersection of independent lies.”^1 Note that here he aspires to a unanimity of classification. When many models make a common classification, our confidence should soar. Our next theorem, the _diversity prediction theorem,_ applies to models that make numerical predictions or valuations. It quantifies the contributions of model accuracy and model diversity to the accuracy of the average of those models.^2
