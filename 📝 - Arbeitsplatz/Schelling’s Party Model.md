Each of N individuals has an observable type A or B. Each person randomly chooses one of two rooms. At each moment a person moves to the other room with probability p. Person i has a tolerance threshold Ti and leaves her room if the percentage of people in the room of her type falls below that threshold. 

To see how segregation arises despite tolerance, imagine a party with 20 Australians and 20 Brazilians. Each person is tolerant and will remain in a room so long as 25% of the people in the room have the same ethnicity. Suppose that initially one room contains 12 Australians and 9 Brazilians and the other contains 8 Australians and 11 Brazilians. No one feels compelled to move, but there will be random movements between rooms, and these will alter the percentages in each room. In figure 19.1, one room contains 11 Australians and only 4 Brazilians. This configuration hovers at a tipping point: if any of the Brazilians leaves, the percentage of Brazilians will fall below 25%, causing the 3 remaining Brazilians to leave as well. If that happens, Brazilians will never move into that room. 

Figure 19.1: A Configuration Poised to Produce Segregation Recall from the random walk model that a one-dimensional random walk will cross any threshold. The number of Australians in a room is a one-dimensional random walk. Therefore, if the party lasts long enough, segregation is inevitable. Even the best parties only last so long, so not all parties end in segregation. We also know that

larger parties are less likely to segregate because the random walk has to cross a much higher threshold when the party has more people. At a party of 1,000 people in two equal sized rooms, we would not expect the proportion of either type to fall below 25% of either type in a room. We would expect that to happen at a party of 12 people. We should therefore expect more segregation at small parties. We should also expect more segregation when people have diverse tolerance thresholds. To see why, assume 10 Brazilians and 10 Australians and assign each person a tolerance threshold between 5% and 45% in such a way that each group has an average tolerance threshold of 25%, as shown in figure 19.2. 

Figure 19.2: Relocations Caused by Heterogeneous Thresholds The room on the left contains 5 Brazilians and 4 Australians, so the proportion of Australians is less than 45%, causing the least tolerant Australian to move to the room on the right (denoted by the arrow #1). When this Australian moves to the other room, she reduces the proportion of Brazilians in that room, causing the least tolerant Brazilian to move (denoted by arrow #2). These two relocations lower the percentage of Australians in the room on the left below 40%, causing the second-least-tolerant Australian to follow her into the room on the right (denoted by arrow #2). A cascade ensues. However, as shown in figure 19.3, the result need not be full segregation, as the most tolerant individuals are comfortable in either room. The model produces two effects of diverse thresholds: they make the tip to segregation more likely and make complete segregation less likely, as very tolerant people are content in either room. This model can help explain variations in gender ratios across profession—why more women work as nurses and more men work in sales. Those differences could be due to preferences, but they

could also arise if some people prefer to work with people of the same gender. This can be made more formal in a _revolving-door model,_ which makes two empirically based assumptions: (i) women who exit a profession choose a new profession with more women, 

and (ii) women leave professions at a higher rate then men.^3 If women in the life sciences leave biomedical research at a faster rate than men and take jobs in professions such as health care that employ more women, their actions increase gender segregation in both professions.

### Schelling’s Segregation Model 

_Schelling’s segregation model_ places agents in distinct locations in geographic space, a checkerboard. Otherwise, it is identical to the party model. It assumes two types of people and makes the same behavioral assumption as Schelling’s party model.
