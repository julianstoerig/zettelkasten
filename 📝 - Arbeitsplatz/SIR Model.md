where P spread, P contact, and P recover equal the probability of spreading the disease, the probability of contact, and the probability of recovery. 

Epidemiologists keep separate track of the probability of contact and the probability of spreading, so we will as well. Contact rates depend on how the disease passes from one person to another. HIV spreads through sexual contact. Diphtheria spreads through saliva. Flu viruses spread through the air. Thus flu has a higher contact probability than diphtheria, which has a higher contact probability than HIV. Once contact occurs, the probability of spread also varies. Pertussis (whooping cough) transfers to another person more readily than SARS. The SIR model produces a _tipping point_ at what is known as the _basic reproduction number (R_ 0 _),_ the ratio of the probability of contact 

times the probability of spread to the probability of recovery. A disease with an _R_ 0 greater than 1 can spread through the 

population. Diseases with _R_ 0 â€™s less than 1 dissipate. In this model, 

the information, or in this case the disease, need not spread to the entire relevant population. Whether or not it does depends on the value of _R_ 0. Hence, government agencies like the Centers for 

Disease Control rely on estimates of _R_ 0 to guide policy.^6
