If people coordinate locally, then global configurations will be patchy and diverse. 

When applying this model, we must keep in mind that many coordinated cultural practices, such as how people mourn their dead or celebrate the birth of a child, are not idiosyncratic curiosities but components of culture, a coherent constellation of behaviors, practices, and artifacts that define who a people are and give them a 

sense of meaning and belonging.^5 As we can with any model, we can experiment with parameters and see how doing so affects the results. For the local interaction model, the size of the patches that form in equilibrium increase faster than the neighborhood size. If we make the neighborhoods, that is, the number of squares that influence a square on the grid, twice as large, the patches become more than twice as large. The model therefore suggests that as technology and urbanization bring us closer together, the force of coordination could result in larger homogeneous patches of behaviors and beliefs. Experiments also show that if we make the configuration a long, narrow rectangle, the model tends to produces horizontal and vertical stripes, as shown in figure 15.2.^6 The zebra-like stripes are an equilibrium because each on (off) cell has five on (off) neighbors. This type of pattern would also be an equilibrium on the square, though it rarely occurs. Perplexing findings like this can result in deep dives into rabbit holes of little empirical or theoretical value. They can also provide insights that lead to deeper, unexpected discoveries. In this instance, the “squares produce Holstein-style patterns and skinny rectangles give zebra-style patterns” result all but begs us to ask if models like this could explain patterns on animal hides.

### The Game of Life 

Our next model, the _Game of Life,_ also assumes cells on a checkerboard that are in one of two states. The key differences will be that the cell’s rule for updating has two thresholds and that all cells update their states synchronously. Thus we can speak of the initial configuration, the configuration at time 1, the configuration at time 2, and so on. Synchronous updating can be thought of as “marching band dynamics” (update! update! update!).^8
