Markov Model A three-state Markov model reveals a nonlinear relationship between transitions to addiction and overall addiction rates. The modelâ€™s states represent people not in pain, people using opioids, and addicts. We estimate the transition probabilities between those states, which we represent as arrows. The model on the left assumes that 1% of of people who use opioids become addicted and that 10% of addicts revert to the no-pain state. It also assumes that 20% of the people in the no-pain state become opioid users. In equilibrium, only 2.2% of the population are addicts. To account for longer prescriptions, the model on the left assumes that 2.5% of people who use opioids become addicted and that 5% of addicts revert to the no-pain state. It also assumes that 20% of the people in the no-pain state become opioid users. Now, in equilibrium, 10% of the population are addicts.^1 

Our third model relies on systems dynamics. This model, like the Markov model, assumes that there are people in pain, people who use opioids, and people no longer in pain. Rather than write transition probabilities between these states, however, it imagines a flow from people in pain to opioid use to people not in pain. More elaborate systems dynamics models can include sources for other drug providers, and allow for movements between opioid and heroin users. In addition, a richer model could include heterogenous types

of potential users. The fact that people who suffer from anxiety and depression are more likely to become addicted could therefore be 

included in the model.^2
