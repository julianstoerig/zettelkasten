For power-law distributions with an exponent of 2 ( a = 2), the rank of an event times its size equals a constant. 

### Event Rank · Event Size = Constant 

The populations of cities in many countries, including the United States, are distributed approximately in this way. Using 2016 city population data, each city’s rank multiplied by its population produces a value near 8 million.

### Models That Produce Power Laws: Logic 

We now turn to models that produce power laws. Lacking models, power-law distributions remain unexplained patterns. Our first model, the _preferential attachment model,_ assumes entities that grow at rates relative to their proportions. It captures Merton’s Matthew effect: more begets more. The model considers a population that grows through arrivals. A new arrival either joins an existing entity or creates a new one. If the latter, the probability of joining an existing entity is proportional to the size of that entity.
