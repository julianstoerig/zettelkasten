In the **learning-the-best-alternative framework,** reinforcement learning with the aspiration level set equal to the average earned reward (eventually) almost always selects the best alternative.

### Social Learning: Replicator Dynamics 

Reinforcement learning assumes an individual acting in isolation. People also learn from watching others. Social learning models assume that individuals see the actions and rewards of others. This can speed the rate of learning. The most widely studied model of social learning, _replicator dynamics,_ assumes that the probability of taking an action depends on the product of its reward and its popularity. We can think of the former as a _reward effect_ and the latter as a _conformity effect_.^6 Most often replicator dynamics models assume an infinite population. We can then characterize the actions taken as a probability distribution across the various alternatives. In the standard construction, time advances in discrete steps so that we can capture learning by changes in the probability distribution.
