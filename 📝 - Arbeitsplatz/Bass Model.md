### The SIR Model 

In the models that we have covered so far, a person who adopts a technology never abandons it. That makes sense for the adoption of technologies like electricity, the dishwasher, and television; we never reverse our adoptions. That assumption does not hold for all things that spread by diffusion. After we catch a disease, we recover. When we adopt a fashion or fad, such as a particular style of dress or a dance step, we can abandon it. Following convention, we refer to people who drop an adoption as _recovered_. The resulting model, the _SIR model_ (susceptible, infected, recovered), occupies a central position in epidemiology. Given the modelâ€™s origins and given that recovery occurs more naturally in diseases, we describe the model using the spread of a disease as an example. To avoid overcomplicating the mathematics, we assume that people who recover reenter the susceptible pool, that being cured of the disease does not create future immunity.
