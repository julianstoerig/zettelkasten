## what makes a choice a choice?

To call something a choice,

To illustrate this point, I will be using the example of a robot that we want to carry out a certain task.

## Agency

**Agency** ist the ability to act in a way that produces an effect.
The question of whether the actor of our scenario has agency is not binary,
it exists along a spectrum.

A robot, equipped with a program to complete its task and equipped with the tools
necessary to complete the task has agency.

## Autonomy

**Autonomy** is the ability to act freely and indipendently.

A robot that fulfils the conditions above would thus be considered to have agency, but not not autonomy, sicne it itself
cannot choose not to fulfil its task.
